While exploring movement with sounds, I tried creating a moving element with sound that interrupts it (upon clicking the a button). It might be Mario-style characters (in a loop?) but also thinking how it might be integrated into a drawing game. 

I'm figuring out how to make the rectangle shape-shift upon clicking 'a'.
